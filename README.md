* I created a Html in order to provide a solid structure for my code and information i wanted to provide in my portfolio

* I included information on my educational background in the About me section along with some work experience 

* The next section that followed was work, this section was made in order for employeers to view my work i have created using the knowledge i have

* After getting the structure of my Html and information, i set comments in it for anyone wanting to read it could closely follow a long.

* Finishing my Html, I created a style.css in order to style and design to the Html

* In the style.css I created a unique style with an image in the background along with an image of myself in the web page

* When connecting both Html and style.css I made sure that the website had proper links to open websites needed to showcase my experience and skills

* When creating these links i made sure they opened in a seperate tab when opening for the user could have a good experience when viewing these web-pages

* Made sure that all links were correct to the the corresponding web-pages.

* Thank you for visisting my Professional Portfolio
